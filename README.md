# Data visualization demo using R Shiny

Work in progress but feel free to take a look...

## Usage

1. Install [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
2. Install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
3. Clone this repository
4. In RStudio: Select File -> Open project -> find shiny-gasoline-demo.Rproj
5. After the project opens, hit **Run App** on the upper right corner of the editor window (or alternatively type `shiny::runApp()` in the Console)

In case missing packages are not automatically installed, run `install.packages("shiny")` and probably `install.packages("plotly")` manually.
